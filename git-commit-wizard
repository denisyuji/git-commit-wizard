I have staged the following changes on branch '$current_branch' in my git repository.
The changes include modifications, additions, or removals in one or more files.
Please generate a commit message that adheres to the Linux project commit guidelines with the following requirements:
  - The commit title must be in the format 'subject: description'.
  - The entire title (subject line) must be no more than 50 characters.
  - Use the imperative mood in the title.
  - Leave a blank line after the title.
  - Format the commit description body with lines no more than 50 characters.
  - Use clear and concise language that summarizes what was changed and why.
  - Do not include any markdown formatting (e.g. triple backticks or code fences).

Below is the diff of the staged changes:
$diff_content

Additionally, here are the original contents of the files before the changes for context:
